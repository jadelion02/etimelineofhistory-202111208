If no one asks me, I know what it is. If I wish to explain it to him who asks, I do not know". <p class="indented">Aristotle viewed the present as something continually changing, the Roman emperor-philosopher Marcus Aurelius described time as a river of passing events. And in the West, at least, many would still identify with these ideas. Much time feels like something that flows in one direction, British physicist Arthur Eddington called this, “the Arrow of Time".<br><br>Physicists define time as the progression of events from the past to the present into the future. Time is considered to be the fourth dimension of reality; it is used to describe events in three-dimensional space. It is not something we can see, touch, or taste; nor it is something we can send, borrow or save, we can only measure its passage.</p><p class="indented">In 1907, a German mathematician and professor Hermann Minkowski, showed that the special theory of relativity of 1905, developed by his former student Albert Einstein, could be understood geometrically as a theory of four-dimensional space-time, now known as the "Minkowski spacetime". He once said, “Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality". In essence: Matter creates time. In the absence of matter, time is irrelevant. <br><br>Although some physicists propose that time does not exist, time perception (our sense of time) does. This is why the evidence from physics is at odds with how life feels. Our shared idea of what the concept of “future” or “past” means may not apply to everything everywhere in the universe, but it does reflect the reality of our lives here on earth. Isaac Newton wrote in his masterwork, the Principia, “Absolute, true, and mathematical time, in and of itself and of its own nature, flows uniformly”. <br><br>In spite of universal acceptance of the Newtonian concept of absolute time, Albert Einstein deduced that there is no fixed frame of reference in the universe. He showed in his theory of special relativity that time is relative. He demonstrated that time moves slowly if an object is moving fast. An object in motion experiences time dilation, meaning that time moves more slowly when one is moving, than when one is standing still. "Einstein concluded that simultaneity is relative; events that are simultaneous for one observer may not be for another," the Encyclopedia Britannica stated. "This led him to the counterintuitive idea that time flows differently according to the state of motion, and to the conclusion that distance is also relative." <br><br>"Time is what keeps everything from happening at once". <em>Ray Cummings, 1919</em><br></p><br><HR WIDTH="60%"><br><font size"+1" font face="Times New Roman" color="black"><p class="indented"><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">e</span><span style="font-weight: bold;">Timeline of History</span> has three timeline periods: 1.

The Bible does not mention how old the universe is or its age. However, based on the calcul<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">ation of the generations from Adam to present, about 6,000 years have passed. According to the Hebrew calendar that governs the passage of time among the Jewish people, the year began in 3761 B.C. (Year One), the year when Adam was created. <br><br>Isaac ben Samuel of Acre (Hebrew: יצחק בן שמואל דמן עכו, Yitzhak ben Shmuel d'min Akko) a 13th-14th century Jewish kabbalist, whose writing was used to calculate the age of the universe. The calculation was based on the view that the universe was 42,000 years old when Adam was created at the beginning of the last 7,000 Sabbatical cycle, and by distinguishing between earthly "solar years" and "divine years," based on a verse from Psalms, which states that "For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday..." <em>Psalm 90:4 (NIV)</em>. Each day of a divine year is equal to a thousand earthly "solar years," then a divine year would be 365,250 years long. Isaac then makes some other calculations based on the Talmud and the Biblical sabbatical year, and arrived at 15,340,500,000 years as the age of the universe.<br><br>Measurements made by NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) spacecraft have shown that the universe is about 13.7 billion years old. The measurements are conducted by making detailed observations of the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and using that information in Einstein's Theory of General Relativity to 'rewind the clock backwards to time equal zero' (i.e. "Big Bang"), or when the universe had "zero" size (i.e. Singularity).<br><br>In Dr. Alexander Poltorak's paper "On the Nature of Time and the Age of the Universe" presented at the International Torah and Science Conference on December 18, 2005, and two articles: "On the Age of the Universe in the Many-Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics", and "Towards Reconciliation of Biblical and Cosmological Ages of the Universe", he demonstrated that the apparent contradiction between the biblical age of the universe and the cosmological age of the universe can be reconciled based on quantum mechanics in its various interpretations.<br><br>According to Dr. Gerald Schroeder in his books (Genesis and the Big Bang, and The Science of God), and articles (Six days and 14 billion years: measuring reality from two perspectives - Jerusalem Post-September 30, 2018, and Age of the Universe), the 6-day creation and 14 billion years of the age of the universe are the same depending on how reality is viewed from two different perspectives. <br><br>Before we go any further into the different perspectives of the age of the universe, let’s refresh our understanding and knowledge of cosmology. <br><br>In 1929, astronomer Edwin Hubble (1889-1953) discovered that distance galaxies were moving away from the earth due to the observed light's wavelength was stretched towards the red spectrum (i.e. redshift). The discovery led to the conclusion that, at some point in time, the universe must have started with a small beginning, and consequently gave rise to the support of the “Big Bang” theory of the universe first proposed by Georges Lemaître in 1927. Subsequent observations of the CMB, the residual heat of creation - faint afterglow of light with nearly uniform intensity that fills the universe, and measurements by the WMAP in 2001 placed a date of the “Big Bang” to approximately 13.77 billion years ago.<br><br>At the moment of the "Big Bang", this very dense and extremely hot speck of space undergone a process of exponential expansion or stretching called “inflation”. This rapid inflation produced a hot radiant of energy which would allow matters to form as described by Einstein's equation E=mc<SUP>2</SUP>, or m=E/c<SUP>2</SUP> (i.e. Mass of matter <b>m</b> equals to Energy <b>E</b> divided by the square of the velocity of light <b>c</b>). The universe cooled as it continued to expand and created a condition giving rise to the building block of particles/anti-particles and later matters (i.e. quarks, photons and electrons). As a result, protons and neutrons were formed at their respective threshold temperatures. When matter was created, the cosmic clock started ticking. However, the relative passage of time varies with the creation of matters (i.e. stars and galaxies due to their differences in local gravity and velocities). The universe has since cooled to its current temperature of about 2.73 <font size"3em"><SUP>o</SUP></font>K <font size"3em">(0<SUP>o</SUP></font> Kelvin K=- 273.15 <font size"3em"><SUP>o</SUP></font>C).<br><br>In his book "The Science of God", Dr. Schroeder describes the exponential stretching of space (i.e. expansion of the universe) since the "Big Bang" also caused the exponential stretching of the wavelength of electromagnetic radiation (i.e. frequencies of visible and invisible lights). This cosmological time - the measurement between the crests or peaks of the wave - would also have been stretched at the same rate. Thus, the stretching of the wave slows the frequency of the cosmic clock, or increasing the wavelength slows the perception of the passage of time. <br><br>The temperature in the universe at quark confinement which corresponds to the frequencies of electromagnetic radiation was approximately a million million <font size"3em">(10<SUP>12</SUP>)</font> times hotter than that of the current cosmic background radiation of space at about 3 <font size"3em"><SUP>o</SUP></font>K. The observed electromagnetic radiation at quark confinement has been stretched a million million <font size"3em">(10<SUP>12</SUP>)</font> times. Hence, the cosmic clock - the perceived time - has been stretched by the same amount.<br><br>Shortly after the "Big Bang" the universe was much smaller than it is today by about a million million times. From that moment looking forward to the time of the creation of Adam, the cosmic clock has been ticking not according to its location but was tuned to the cosmic radiation. This cosmic clock has stopped ticking since Adam was created. When we view our universe from our perspective, 13.7 billion of years have passed since the "Big Bang", it is the age of the observable universe. The passage of time of one second on the cosmic clock, the Earth clock would have indicated a passing of a million million seconds. <br><br>The equation used by Dr. Schroeder to view the two different perspectives is (based on the universe being 15 billion years old):<br><br><font size"4em"> <I>A</I></font><font size"2em"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;</font><font size"4em"> <I>A<sub>0</sub></I> <I>e </I> <SUP>-Lt</SUP></font><br><font size"4em" font face="Times New Roman" color="black">where:<br><I>A</I>&emsp;&ensp;- Earth time in day (24-hour).<br><I>A<sub>0</sub></I>&emsp;- The ratio of CMB radiation frequency or threshold energy temperature of protons (10.9 x 10<font size"3em"><SUP>12 o</SUP><font size"4em">K) to current value (2.73 <font size"3em"><SUP>o</SUP><font size"4em">K).<br><I>e</I>&emsp; - Natural log=2.718.<br>L &emsp;- Natural log of 2=0.693.<br>t &emsp; - Genesis days from 0 to 6 divided by half period.<br><br>To view the perspectives from Earth (i.e. the area under the curve), apply integration to the equation:<br><br><font size"4em"><I>∫ A</I></font><font size"2em"> &nbsp;=&nbsp;<font size"4em"> (<I>-A<sub>0 </sub></I>/ L) <I>e </I> <SUP>-Lt</SUP></font><br><br><font size"4em" font face="Times New Roman" color="black">Instead of using the equation above, another similar equation could be used, and this is the Radioactive Decay equation or the Radioactive Half-life equation:<br><br><font size"4em"> <I>N</I></font><font size"2em"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=&nbsp;<font size"4em"> <I>N<sub>0</sub></I> <I>e </I> <SUP>-λt</SUP></font><br><font size"4em" font face="Times New Roman" color="black">where:<br><I>N</I>&emsp;&ensp;- Final condition.<br><I>N<sub>0</sub></I>&emsp; - Initial condition.<br><I>e</I>&emsp;&ensp; - Natural log=2.718.<br>λ &emsp;&ensp;- Decay constant=0.693.<br>t &emsp;&ensp; - Day's Half-life=Half Day.<br><br>Solving the equation provides us with the two different perspectives: From the perspective of the Earth looking backward in time, or from the perspective shortly after the universe was created looking forward. <br><br>For example: As the universe expands, time also expands (stretches). Looking forward from Day 1 into the "future", it took 24 hours to reach the second day as the universe was relatively small. However, from the perspective of the Earth looking backward, Day 1 started at the moment of the "Big Bang" (about 13,770,000,000 B.C.), and it took a little over 7&pm; billion years to reach the next day. Day 2 started in 6,770,000,000 B.C., and Day 6 started in 210 million B.C., etc. This cosmic clock stopped ticking when Adam was created, and the Earth clock started ticking in about 6,000 years ago (about 3761 B.C.).

For nearly 6,000 years, human activities (conflicts and trade) and the environment (famine and natural disaster) caused a major shift in the way plant and animal communities were structured. Along with animal domestication, human civilization enters a period dominated by agricultural farming, herding, and ranching. We move from being primarily hunter-gatherers to an early agrarian culture. Alongside our cultural advances, human culture and knowledge developed at a spectacular rate. Empires rise and fall across the globe, as do various religions. Scientific advances begin to occur, transforming our understanding of the universe.<br><br>The timeline begins with Adam, as the Hebrew year count starts in year 3761 B.C. Years in the calendar are designated AM to identify them as part of the Anno Mundi epoch, indicating the age of the world according to the interpretation of the Bible. The Hebrew calendar is comparatively imprecise in terms of reflecting the duration of a solar year, which is the time it takes the earth to complete a full orbit around the sun. <br><br>A day may be added to or subtracted from specific months in the calendar to prevent certain holidays (such as Rosh Hashana) from falling on certain days of the week. A leap year in the Hebrew calendar has 13 months and it is periodically added to approximately stay in sync with the astronomical seasons and it occurs seven times in a 19-year Metonic cycle. This way, the Hebrew calendar deviates from the solar year by one day every 216 years. <br><br>Events occur every day all over the world, one part may be celebrating an achievement, other part may be recovering from a disaster, and some are just a footnote in a history book. The years in which events happened long ago may not coincide with events happened in other parts of the world as different calendars were utilized to record events. Until civilization adopts a common or international system of recording the passage of time, comparing the record of events in different parts of the world seems futile. Nevertheless, attempts have been made to reconcile the differences and established some common understanding of the discrepancies between different ways of recording the passage of time.<br><br>This History Timeline includes ancient civilizations using different systems for time keeping, therefore some of the events may be only an approximation. <br><br><br><b><em>3. <a href="Revelation.htm">Revelation Timeline</em></a></b><br><br>"The past is no more; the future is yet to come; and the present is like a blink of an eye - so whence comes worry?" A fleeting sensation of time attributed to Avraham ibn Ezra (Hebrew: אַבְרָהָם בֶּן מֵאִיר אִבְּן עֶזְרָא‎‎ ʾAḇrāhām ben Mēʾīr ʾībn ʾĒzrāʾ).<br><br>The Book of Revelation is the final book of the Bible, an example of apocalyptic literature that predicts a final celestial war through prophecy. Authorship is ascribed to John, but little else is known about the writer.<br><br>According to the text, it was written around 95 A.D. on the island Patmos, an island off the coast of Turkey. Revelation is not just about the future. It is also about the past and very much about the present - perhaps primarily about the present. For it was written to be read and heard in the present age; it provides an essential component for the church’s understanding of life in this world of the coming of Christ.<br><br></span></p><p class="indented"><button onclick="myFunction()" id="myBtn">Read more</button><br><HR WIDTH="60%"><br><font size="4" font face="Times New Roman" color="brown"><center>Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, <br>and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand.</center><br><font face="標楷體"><center>念這書上預言的和那些聽見又遵守其中所記載的，都是有福的，因為日期近了。</center> <br><font size="4" font face="Times New Roman" color="brown"><center> He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God and he will be my son.</center> <br><font face="標楷體"><center>得勝的，必承受這些為業：我要作他的　神，他要作我的兒子。 <br><em>Rev. 1:3; 21:7 (KJV) - 啟示錄(和合本)</em></center><br><HR WIDTH="60%"><font face="Times New Roman" color="black"></p><br><br>
